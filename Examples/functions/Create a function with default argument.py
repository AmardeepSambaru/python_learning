# Create a function with default argument

# Write a program to create a function show_employee() using the following conditions.
# It should accept the employeeâ€™s name and salary and display both.
# If the salary is missing in the function call then assign default value 9000 to salary
# output = Name: Ben salary: 12000
#          Name: Jessa salary: 9000

#salary = 9000
